routing:
-> with routing , we match different urls to different UI views (react components):Routes
->This enables users to navigate between different applications screens,using the browser urls
->Keeps the UI in sync with the current browser url 

www.eg.com/ -> www.eg.com/login -> www.eg.com/app

Single page applications:
->application that is executed entirely on the client(browser)
->Routes:different URLs correspond to different views(components)
->Javascript(react) is used to update the page(DOM)
->The Page is never reloaded
->Feels like a native app
->Additional data might be loaded from a web api
